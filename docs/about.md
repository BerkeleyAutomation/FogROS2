FogROS 2 is an open-source cloud-robotics pilot platform from UC Berkeley.  Cloud computing using commercial clusters such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) is now fast enough to enable secure compute-intensive robot functions such as SLAM map building from video, grasp planning, and high dimensional motion planning to be performed in the Cloud using high-performance hardware and GPUs in near real-time.   FogROS 2 offers ROS 2 functions to streamline the deployment of robot code. Developers do not need to change their codeâ€“they need only to specify an AWS configuration of computers that they want their code to run.  FogROS 2 coordinates the details of initiating hardware instances, installing software and dependencies, securing robot-cloud communication, and launching cloud processes.

In example applications, we used FogROS 2 to deploy compute-intensive ROS 2 nodes for SLAM, Grasp Planning, and Motion Planning to the cloud.  For Visual SLAM, we ran an [ORB-SLAM 2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) Node on a multi-core cloud computer and we got a 2x speedup.  For Grasp Planning, we ran the [Dex-Net](https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/dex-net) Node on a GPU instance in the cloud and got a 12x speedup.  For Motion Planning, we ran [Motion Planning Templates](https://robotics.cs.unc.edu/mpt/) on a 96-core cloud computer and got a 28x speedup.
