# FogROS2

[`FogROS2`](https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/FogROS2) extends ROS 2 for cloud deployment of computational graphs in a security-conscious manner. It allows researchers to easily and securely deploy ROS abstractions across cloud providers with minimal effort, thus gaining access to additional computing substrates including CPU cores, GPUs, FPGAs, or TPUs, as well as pre-deployed software made available by other researchers. To do so, `FogROS2` extends the ROS 2 launch system, introducing additional syntax to allow roboticists to specify at launch time which components of their architecture will be deployed to the cloud and which components will be deployed on the edge.

## Install
### Quickstart
If you are new to ROS and Ubuntu, and want to install FogROS 2 (and ROS 2) and its requisites from scratch, follow instructions [here.](https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/FogROS2/blob/humble/QUICKSTART.md)
### Docker (Recommended)
Alternatively, you can simplify reproduction using an OS virtualization environment with Docker:
```bash
git clone -b humble https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/FogROS2
cd FogROS2
docker build -t fogros2 .
```

(*Note: the Dockerfile is cooked for x86_64. If you're using a workstation with an Arm-based architecture (e.g. an M1), build the container with the `docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t fogros2 .`*.)

### Natively
`FogROS2` is actually a ROS meta-package, so you can just fetch it in your favorite workspace, build it, source the workspace as an overlay and start using its capabilities.

#### Install Dependencies

ROS 2 dependencies:
```
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl gnupg lsb-release
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(source /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ros-rolling-desktop


sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64] http://repo.ros2.org/ubuntu/main `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2-latest.list'
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -

```

FogROS 2 dependencies:
```
sudo apt install python3-pip wireguard unzip
sudo pip3 install wgconfig boto3 paramiko scp

# install AWS CLI
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

```bash
cd <your-ros2-workspace>/src
git clone https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/FogROS2
cd ../
colcon build --merge-install  # re-build the workspace
source install/setup.bash
```


## Launch ROS 2 computational graphs in the cloud
TODO: replace this with fogros2 tooling that's cloud-agnostic. E.g. `ros2 fog configure --aws`, instead of `fogros2`.

### Docker (Recommended)

(*Note: the Dockerfile is cooked for x86_64. If you're using a workstation with an Arm-based architecture (e.g. an M1), run the container with the `docker run -it --platform linux/amd64 --rm --net=host --cap-add=NET_ADMIN fogros2`*.)

```bash
# launch fogros2 container
docker run -it --rm --net=host --cap-add=NET_ADMIN fogros2
# configure cloud provider CLI wrappers (e.g. AWS)
aws configure

# launch talker node on the cloud
ros2 launch fogros2_examples talker.ubuntu.2204.launch.py
```

### Native
```bash
source install/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp 

# if using Ubuntu 20.04
export CYCLONEDDS_URI=file://$(pwd)/install/share/fogros2/configs/cyclonedds.ubuntu.2004.xml
# if using Ubuntu 22.04
export CYCLONEDDS_URI=file://$(pwd)/install/share/fogros2/configs/cyclonedds.ubuntu.2204.xml

ros2 launch fogros2_examples talker.aws.launch.py
```

## Run your own robotics applications
Step 1: Mount your robotics application to docker's folder.
For example,
```
docker run -it --rm \
    --net=host --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
       ....
    -v FOLDER_IN_YOUR_LOCAL_DIR:/home/root/fog_ws/src/YOUR_PKG_NAME \
       ...
    keplerc/ros2:latest /bin/bash
```
you may also `git clone` your development repo to the docker instead.


Step 2: Write the FogROSlaunch file. Examples of launch files can be found in the talker*.launch.py in https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/FogROS2/tree/humble/fogros2_examples/launch


## Setting Up Automatic Image Transport
Step 1: Identify all topics that need to use a compressed transport.

Step 2: In a `fogros2.CloudNode`, add the parameter `stream_topics=[]`, where `stream_topics` is a list of tuples
where each tuple is just a pair of `(TOPIC_NAME, TRANSPORT_TYPE)` values.

`TOPIC_NAME` is the string that represents the name of the topic that publishes `sensor_msgs/Image`

Valid `TRANSPORT_TYPE` values are `compressed`, `theora`, and `raw` if only `image-transport` and `image-transport-plugins` are installed on the system. `h264` is another valid `TRANSPORT_TYPE` if step 3 is followed.

Step 3 (Optional): If using H.264, please also clone the H.264 decoder found [here](https://github.com/clydemcqueen/h264_image_transport) into the workspace's src directory. The current repo only contains the encoder and the full image transport pipeline will not work without the decoder also.

Example of `stream_topics` argument:

`stream_topics=[('/camera/image_raw', 'h264'), ('/camera2/image_raw', 'compressed')]`

Adding the above argument to a `fogros2.CloudNode` makes the topic `/camera/image_raw` publish using the `h264 image_transport`, and makes the topic `/camera2/image_raw` publish using the `compressed image_transport`.

Please note that all cloud nodes that are expecting raw images will be remapped to `TOPIC_NAME/cloud` to remove any topic naming conflicts. (TODO: Automate remapping)

## Command Line Interface
We currently support the following CLIs for easier debugging and development.

```bash
# list the existing FogROS instances
ros2 fog list

# SSH to the corresponding instance (e.g. named "ascent-corona")
# the -n name can be found by the above list command
ros2 fog connect ascent-corona

# delete the existing FogROS instance (e.g. named "ascent-corona")
ros2 fog delete ascent-corona
# or all of the existing instances
ros2 fog delete -a
```

## Developer

Here are some commands that one may find it useful when developing:
```bash

# starting the second terminal for fogros docker
docker exec -it $(docker ps | grep fogros2 | awk '{print $1}') /bin/bash
```


## Creating an AMI Image from An Existing Launched FogRos Instance

This can be easily done using our CLI command:

```bash
# make image from fogros instance
ros2 fog image -n instance_name
```
Alternatively, you can create your AMI image from the AWS website:

See more information [here.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/tkv-create-ami-from-instance.html)

Step 1: Log into your AWS account and locate your list of instances. 

Step 2: Right-click on the FogROS instance, and choose Create Image from the menu options.

Step 3: In the Create Image dialog box, type a unique name and description, and then choose Create Image. 

Note that Amazon EC2 shuts down the instance by default before creating the AMI and then reboots the instance. Choose the No reboot option if you don't want your instance to be shut down.

## Running Examples:
# NOTE: (mjd3) These should likely be moved to the examples repo

#### To run gqcnn
```

in ros workspace.

#### TODO
- Streamline the launch process for client docker images.

## Some Common Issues
1. Warning: _2 packages has stderr outputs: fogros2 fogros2_examples_ after running colcon build. This is not an error. See https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/FogROS2/issues/45. Your installatiion should still work.  
2. _[WARN] [1652044293.921367226] [fogros2.scp]: [Errno None] Unable to connect to port 22 on xx.xx.xx.xxx, retrying..._ . You need to wait. This is caused when AWS has not started the instance (yet). 
3. _WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager. It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead: https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/venv_. This is fine. Your setup should still work nontheless
